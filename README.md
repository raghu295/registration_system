# registration_system
This web application is a basic implementation of a user registration system with password strength checking and CAPTCHA verification.

## Overview

This project aims to create a secure registration system prototype for online communities. The system utilizes Python as the programming language, Django as the web framework, enforces specific password strength criteria, and incorporates Google reCAPTCHA2 Checkbox for enhanced security during the registration process.

3. **Captcha Solution:**
   - Google reCAPTCHA2 Checkbox

4. **Secure System Design:**
   - Passwords securely hashed
   - Policies for password change frequency
   - Encryption techniques applied where necessary

5. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Rigorous testing methodologies, including unit and integration testing
   - Performance evaluation tools: Apache JMeter
